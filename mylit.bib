    abstract     = {The landslide of cohesive soil slope is generally characterized by deformation and failure behaviors involving strain softening and strain-dependent dilation. However, numerical simulation of these complex behaviors remains a challenge since no available soil constitutive model can incorporate all these features. To resolve this problem, a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH)-based approach is developed to simulate the landslide of cohesive soil slope. The cohesive soil slope is modeled as elasto-plastic material with Drucker--Prager yield criterion, and the corresponding softening effect is introduced into Drucker--Prager criterion by treating cohesion as a scalar function of accumulative plastic strain rate. To reduce excessive volume expansion, strain-dependent dilation is fulfilled in a straightforward manner by assuming the dilation angle as a function of volumetric and axial plastic strain increment. Numerical collapse test of cohesive soil pile on a flat plane is conducted to validate the proposed SPH-based approach. The further deformation triggered by softening effect is obtained. The obtained results are compared with those of existing SPH-based method and FEM simulation. Finally, the proposed SPH-based approach is applied to simulate the landslide of an actual cohesive soil slope. The simulation results, including deposit, run out distance, slip surface and final outline, are compared with the field data and classical FEM simulation.}

    abstract     = {A new formulation is introduced for enforcing incompressibility in Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). The method uses a fractional step with the velocity field integrated forward in time without enforcing incompressibility. The resulting intermediate velocity field is then projected onto a divergence-free space by solving a pressure Poisson equation derived from an approximate pressure projection. Unlike earlier approaches used to simulate incompressible flows with SPH, the pressure is not a thermodynamic variable and the Courant condition is based only on fluid velocities and not on the speed of sound. Although larger time-steps can be used, the solution of the resulting elliptic pressure Poisson equation increases the total work per time-step. Efficiency comparisons show that the projection method has a significant potential to reduce the overall computational expense compared to weakly compressible SPH, particularly as the Reynolds number, Re, is increased. Simulations using this SPH projection technique show good agreement with finite-difference solutions for a vortex spin-down and Rayleigh–Taylor instability. The results, however, indicate that the use of an approximate projection to enforce incompressibility leads to error accumulation in the density field.},

In {FS}-{DEM}, Fourier series-based particle geometric description and coordinate representation are introduced, where particle shapes are implicitly determined by {FS} coefficients, which remain constant and are independent of particle positions or kinematics. Using the {FS}-based particle representation, contact detection and resolution algorithms are then developed to identify contacts and resolve contact geometric features. The {FS}-{DEM} method is completed with recourse to conventional contact behavior, laws of motion, and movement integration. The accuracy and computational efficiency of the {FS}-{DEM} framework are evaluated via three numerical examples and compared with the Overlapping Discrete Element Cluster-based {DEM} method. Results demonstrate the robust and superior performance of the {FS}-{DEM} method and its potential for efficient computational modeling of irregular-shaped particle systems.},

    abstract     = {Contact detection significantly affects the computational efficiency of discrete element simulations, especially for irregularly shaped elements. The dilated polyhedron is constructed by the Minkowski sum of a dilated sphere and a core convex polyhedron. One of the greatest advantages of using the dilated polyhedron in contact detection lies in its ability to be solved by calculating the nearest distance between corresponding core polyhedra. The approximate envelope function ({AEF}) of a dilated polyhedron is formed by the weighted summation of the second-order dilated function of the polyhedral and spherical functions. The {AEF} can be used to represent the element in the optimization model for the contact center. Geometric calculations are then employed for the contact points on the core polyhedron, whereupon the contact detection is solved. The accuracy and stability of the proposed method by a 3-D Voronoi tessellation are validated using analytical solutions and previously published simulation results. The efficiency tests show that the speedup of the {CPU}-based multithread algorithm can reach 14 on a desktop. The direct shear test of the Voronoi shaped ballast is analyzed by this method. The shear stress under different vertical pressure is compared with previously published experimental and simulated results.},

    abstract     = {Problems of fluid–structure interaction with free-surface flow and multiple bodies are highly nonlinear phenomena, which is challenging for computational modeling and simulation. Particle-based methods have been proven to provide a substantial potential for simulation of free-surface fluid flows and their interactions with multiple solids that are often encountered in fluvial and coastal mechanics fields, due to their Lagrangian tracking scheme and meshless nature. When contact between solids occurs, a numerical modeling to detect it and prevent penetration between bodies is required to avoid numerical inconsistencies. The objective of this work is to propose a solid–solid contact model that relays on contact mechanics theories and, by an effective way to determine the normal direction of contact as well as the distance between bodies faces, eliminates the numerical instabilities induced by non-smooth modeling of bodies surfaces in the particle-based methods. The model adopts a penalty-based method that uses a nonlinear spring and dashpot concept, and thus reproducing the macroscopic properties of the multiple bodies interactions. To avoid very small time step for all the domain, a dynamic sub-cycling algorithm for rigid bodies contact is adopted. First, the present fluid solver, based on the moving particle semi-implicit method, is validated by hydrodynamic and fluid–structure interaction problems. Then, analytical and numerical results are compared, demonstrating the improvements achieved by the proposed model. Finally, the present model is validated via 3D dam breaking events, in which rigid bodies interact with each other or with fixed walls.},

The fluid flow considered is governed by the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations and modelled by employing stabilised low order velocity–pressure finite elements. The motion of the fluid domain is accounted for by an arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian ({ALE}) strategy. The rigid body motion, excited by the fluid flow, is restricted by the elastic and damping properties of the supports. For the temporal discretisation the discrete implicit generalised-α method is employed. The resulting strongly coupled set of nonlinear equations is solved by means of a novel partitioned solution procedure, which is based on the Newton–Raphson methodology and incorporates full linearisation of the overall incremental problem. The strong coupling is resolved and optimal convergence of the residuals is achieved. Several numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of the methodology. The examples clearly capture the phenomena of vortex induced oscillations and galloping.},

    abstract     = {Granular materials in industrial applications or nature usually consist of a wide variety of differently formed particles. Very often the shape of the involved objects does not even reveal any symmetry. For the simulation of these particle systems the Discrete Element Method based on spherical or symmetric shaped particles like ellipses/ellipsoids or superquadrics is therefore inadequate. A numerical implementation addressing this problem was found by introducing particles clustered from simpler geometries like spheres. Based on this approach, known as the multi-sphere method, it is possible to ensure computational efficiency for contact detection and force calculation on the one hand, but also allow a suitable representation of shape on the other hand. Today this approach is implemented in several commercial DEM-packages. However, studies on the validity of this approach have only been performed in limited cases. To address this situation, an experimental study performed by Gorham and Kharaz [D.A. Gorham, A.H. Kharaz, The measurement of particle rebound characteristics, Powder Technology 112 (3), 193–202 (2000)] is modeled using the multi-sphere approach. The spherical aluminum oxide particle used in the investigation is approximated by a number of smaller spherical bodies. Macroscopic collision properties are calculated and compared to experimental and numerical results obtained for a rigid spherical particle.

The interactions between solid and ﬂuid were modeled by the ﬁnite volume particle (FVP) method. The distinct element method (DEM) together with a multitime-step algorithm was introduced into the FVP method to calculate the effects of contact between solid bodies and between solid bodies and walls. The introduced DEM model was veriﬁed by experimental analyses for the collapse of multiple solid cylinder layers. The proposed algorithm using the optimized DEM model was then applied to a water dam breaking, involving multiple solid cylinder layers. A comparison between experiments and simulations demonstrated the DEM model introduced into the FVP method is effective in representing solid–ﬂuid mixture ﬂows reasonably well.},

However, AWJ cutting of composite laminates possesses several challenges. It is necessary to develop a methodology to adapt the process parameters for each type of FRP \& CFRP material which will allow AWJ trimming operations to be easily carried out on composite materials, since machine manufacturers still do not provide good databases for composite cutting. The presented work aims at studying the behaviour of a machinability model in composite materials. The machinability index for various composite materials with different thicknesses was found experimentally, which showed very different results for different materials. A study of the effect of the abrasive waterjet process parameters on the quality of cut (taper and surface roughness) was carried out.},

Researchers did a number of experiments on cutting of different grades of steel, copper, aluminium, 87\% alumina ceramics, Ti6Al4V, different types of stone etc by AWJM. Though, applicability of AWJM on crystalline materials is established, yet no such work is found on amorphous materials. Borosilicate glass is one of the most regularly used amorphous engineering materials. Brittleness of this glass puts limitation on its machining by conventional machining processes. In this article, experiments are conducted on cutting of borosilicate glass by AWJM. Depth of cut is measured with different machine parameter settings – water pressure, abrasive flow rate, traverse speed and standoff distance. Model, thus developed, on depth of cut gives an idea of the influence of different parameters on cutting of amorphous borosilicate glass by AWJM. Optimum condition of control parameter setting is also searched through particle swarm optimization (PSO). In addition, scanning electron microscopic image reveals to some extent, the nature of cut surface and erosion behaviour of amorphous material qualitatively.},

In particular, it has been applied for difficult-to-cut materials, mostly metals, which are used in various manufacturing processes in the fabrication industry. Due to its vast applications, in-depth comprehension of the systems behind its cutting process is required to determine its effective usage. This paper presents a review of the progress in the recent trends regarding abrasive waterjet cutting application to extend the understanding of the significance of cutting process parameters. This review aims to append a substantial understanding of the recent improvement of abrasive waterjet machine process applications, and its future research and development regarding precise cutting operations in metal fabrication sectors. To date, abrasive waterjet fundamental mechanisms, process parameter improvements and optimization reports have all been highlighted. This review can be a relevant reference for future researchers in investigating the precise machining of metallic materials or characteristic developments in the identification of the significant process parameters for achieving better results in abrasive waterjet cutting operations.},

abstract = {In this paper, the Entropically Damped Artificial Compressibility (EDAC) formulation of Clausen (2013) is used in the context of the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method for the simulation of incompressible fluids. Traditionally, weakly-compressible SPH (WCSPH) formulations have employed artificial compressiblity to simulate incompressible fluids. EDAC is an alternative to the artificial compressiblity scheme wherein a pressure evolution equation is solved in lieu of coupling the fluid density to the pressure by an equation of state. The method is explicit and is easy to incorporate into existing SPH solvers using the WCSPH formulation. This is demonstrated by coupling the EDAC scheme with the recently proposed Transport Velocity Formulation (TVF) of Adami etÂ al.Â (2013). The method works for both internal flows and for flows with a free surface. Several benchmark problems are considered to evaluate the proposed scheme and it is found that the EDAC scheme gives results that are as good or sometimes better than those produced by the TVF or standard WCSPH. The scheme is robust and produces smooth pressure distributions and does not require the use of an artificial viscosity in the momentum equation although using some artificial viscosity is beneficial.}

    abstract = {This work presents a three-dimensional two-way coupled method to simulate moving solids in viscous free-surface flows. The fluid flows are solved by weakly compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and the displacement and rotation of the solids are calculated using the multisphere discrete element method (DEM) allowing for the contact mechanics theories to be used in arbitrarily shaped solids. The fluid and the solid phases are coupled through Newton’s third law of motion. The proposed method does not require a computational mesh, nor does it rely on empirical models to couple the fluid and solid phases. To verify the numerical model, the floating and sinking processes of a rectangular block in a water tank are simulated, and the numerical results are compared with experimental results reported in published literatures. The results indicate that the method presented in this paper is accurate and is capable of modelling fluid-solid interactions with a free-surface.},

    abstract = {This study developed a novel two-way dynamic coupled numerical model to simulate moving solids in free surface flows. The fluid flows and hydrodynamic pressures are simulated by a Large Eddy Simulation model, and the free surface is tracked by the Volume-of-Fluid (VOF) method. The fluid response from the solid motion is modeled through specifying the cell-face velocity with partial-cell treatment (PCT). The displacement and rotation of the solids are calculated by the Discrete Element Method (DEM). In order to verify the present model, two laboratory experiments of rectangular blocks floating and sinking in a water tank are conducted. The numerical simulations compare favorably with the experimental results on the trajectory of the moving blocks. The numerical scheme presented in this paper can be used as a design tool for practical problems involved moving objects in free-surface flows.},
